The foundation crumbles, the rug is pulled out from under your feet. Total loss. The three moments of breaking apart – the columns crashing down, the 6 of hearts card ripped in half, the broken chain –  speak to loss, separation, mourning, grief. But the broken chain also references freedom, and the opportunity to find description elsewhere once recovery is found. Breaking free from the ego. The traumatic moment of the Tower points to a moment where the separation of the self from the soul is acutely felt.

A mask, showing where information is obscured, possibly manipulated, intentionally confusing, misleading, and unclear. But also information that is secret for another reason– esoteric knowledge, magical thinking, psychic ability, the tides, and memory. Hidden deep within all of us is both ancient animal instinct and ancient human wisdom. Can be a sign of addiction or deception. The wolf shown has both a wild nature and a magical one, as he balances the crescent moon. The dual nature of the moon – the shadow side, the darkness, and also the source of feminine, receptive empowerment – is shown in the two masks of the Joker card.

    description: "Discord. Attacking others due to selfish needs. Making situations worse than they need to be. Causing drama as a way to assert yourself. Conversely, choosing your battles wisely. Not every injustice needs to be righted, by you, right now. Changing your perspective to see where you have been in the wrong, where you have been the aggressor unnecessarily, perhaps to find a fairer way to relate to others. Acting against your own interests due to pride. One wolf attacks another, not understanding that they are the same. Deciding to relate to others in a kinder way.",

    description: "Transition. Can describe a dark moment, as the light on the other end might not be seen yet. An in-between moment, which can feel uncomfortable in its ambiguity. Travelling – from one place to another, from one relationship to another, from one life to another. A temporary situation. A swan, a symbol of transformation, swims from one bank to another, while butterflies, another symbol of transformation, fly in a downward formation above her. Change is inevitable and necessary but not always easy. Accepting assistance from others during this time, a need to be gentle on yourself whenever movement is required.",

Only looking out for number one – or being in a tricky situation where you need to think of yourself first. Extracting yourself from drama – or playing into the drama. Outwitting someone. Being political in your interactions. A hand tests out the sharpness of an arrow while a snake looks on. Six more arrows are ready and waiting. Words are weapons when used intentionally against another person.",

Letting other people’s actions or perspectives dominate your own way of being, rather than working from an internal strength or intuition. Frustration at a situation. Feelings of helplessness that keep you from seeing your own agency. Flies are trapped in the spider’s web, although they are not yet killed.

Feeling tied to the past. Rumination. A need to release old habits and thoughts in order to be lighter and freer. A pile of skulls intertwines with chains and cobwebs.
