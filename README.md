## Description

A tiny app that lends itself to the moments of clarity and guidance found in the tarot.


Utilizing Rachel Howe’s Small Spells tarot deck and writings, this app aims to help us check in with the energy of any situation through a simple three-card-pull. We can look at these cards as “past” “present” and ”future” in order to note how we may shift our mindset to more gracefully move through any situation in question.
