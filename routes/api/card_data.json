The clock – just past noon or midnight, the start of a new cycle – is intertwined with the compass, intertwined with the spider’s web, showing there are many paths to take. The egg cracking open from the blossoming flower, and the emerging worm, are signs of new life, fresh eyes, a new morning, a new perspective. The need to start over with a fresh and clean slate.

The institutions that shape the way you live: the job you go to every day, the school you attend, your neighborhood, and your community. These can act as either support or confinement. Understanding structure as a tool rather than law. Finding a solid base so that you can take action from a secure place. Making sense of the world. Various shapes and structures are stacked in a row, showing how balance is needed between organically recognizing forms to create safety out of chaos, and imposing rule in an attempt to control.

The rose tethered to the spider web shows us a place where the only limits are in our thoughts, and therefore they can be expanded. The butterflies refer to transformation, to re-configuration, to growth. Learning how to integrate a mystical practice, a connection to the mysterious self, in the real world.

Tied down, tied to someone or something. Karmically under contract. A master dynamic, holding power. Abuse. Toxic connections. The seduction of self-destruction. Momentary pleasure at the expense of long-lasting contentment. A rejection of beneficial values due to the ego being stronger than the soul.

The foundation crumbles, the rug is pulled out from under your feet. Total loss. The three moments of breaking apart – the columns crashing down, the 6 of hearts card ripped in half, the broken chain –  speak to loss, separation, mourning, grief. But the broken chain also references freedom, and the opportunity to find meaning elsewhere once recovery is found. Breaking free from the ego. The traumatic moment of the Tower points to a moment where the separation of the self from the soul is acutely felt.

The Egyptian sky goddess Nut is shown arcing over the natural worlds of the earth and sea, shown by the birds and fish, while she contains the qualities of fire and air, the stars in the sky.

A mask, showing where information is obscured, possibly manipulated, intentionally confusing, misleading, and unclear. But also information that is secret for another reason– esoteric knowledge, magical thinking, psychic ability, the tides, and memory. Hidden deep within all of us is both ancient animal instinct and ancient human wisdom. Can be a sign of addiction or deception. The wolf shown has both a wild nature and a magical one, as he balances the crescent moon. The dual nature of the moon – the shadow side, the darkness, and also the source of feminine, receptive empowerment – is shown in the two masks of the Joker card.
